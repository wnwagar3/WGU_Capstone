# WGU_Capstone
Undergrad Capstone Analysis Project
This is an investigation into a data set regarding text message reminders for medical appointments.
The investigation was a deep dive into the dataset to obtain descriptive and diagnositic statistics for the hypothetical program
that was just rolled out. The statistics would hypothetically be used as a baseline for the program so that further investigations
could be conducted and there would be a baseline to measure the effectiveness of changes implemented vs. original baseline.
This investigation is completely hypothetical using an anonomized data set from Kaggle to complete my undergraduate capstone project.
